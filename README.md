## Summary

This analysis focuses on examining the relationship between implied and realised volatility in the most liquid U.S. equities, with the goal of drawing insights into market mispricing. The project involves processing and structuring a large dataset containing option and underlying asset information, followed by the calculation of key volatility metrics. A key aspect of the analysis is identifying mispriced securities by comparing implied volatility to realised volatility, which can signal potential opportunities for traders who have more accurate forecasts.

A Heterogeneous Autoregressive (HAR) model was implemented to predict realised volatility for options with one month to expiration, using lagged implied volatility figures from multiple expiration months as features. The performance of the HAR model was assessed by comparing its predictions to the implied volatility, with mean absolute error (MAE) used as the metric for evaluation. Although the model achieved a slight improvement in predictive accuracy, it was tested on a small dataset over a short time frame, and the focus was on familiarising with handling option data and drawing insights, rather than achieving high prediction accuracy.
